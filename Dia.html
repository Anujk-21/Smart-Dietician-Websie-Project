                        It's important to keep in mind that portion sizes are just as important as the type of food you eat. 
                        To keep your blood sugar levels stable, aim to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of 
                        three large meals. Additionally, limiting your intake of added sugars, saturated and trans fats, and sodium 
                        can also help manage blood sugar levels.

It's always a good idea to work with a registered dietitian or a healthcare provider to 
create a personalized plan that fits your specific needs and health conditions.

                        It's important to limit your intake of salt, saturated and trans fats, 
                        and added sugars. Additionally, incorporating plenty of fruits and vegetables, 
                        whole grains, lean protein sources, and healthy fats can help lower blood pressure and 
                        improve heart health. Aim to drink plenty of water and limit your intake of alcohol.
