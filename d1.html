                <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized 
                    by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar). 
                    It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin,
                     leading to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.</p>

               <h3> Hypertension</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. 
                    It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of
                    the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart 
                    has to work harder to pump blood.

                <h3>Hypothyroidism</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism means that the thyroid gland can't 
                    make enough thyroid hormone to keep the body running normally. People are hypothyroid if they have
                    too little thyroid hormone in the blood. Common causes are autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 
                    surgical removal of the thyroid, and radiation treatment.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, 
                    causing them to become inflamed and narrowed due to inflammation and 
                    tightening of the muscles around them. Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheeze, 
                    shortness of breath and chest tightness.
